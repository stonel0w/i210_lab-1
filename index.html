          <h3>City History</h3>
          <p>
            Fishers was first settled in 1802. Settlers began to move into the
            area after Indiana's statehood was granted in 1816. The name
            "Fishers" comes from Fishers' Switch, a railroad stop built in the
            area in 1891. The name Fishers was officially granted in 1908. The
            initial population in the early 1960s was only about 340 people, but
            as the town grew, so did it's people. By 2010, Fishers had a
            population of about 38,000, and officially became a city from a town
            in 2012.

          <h3>Connor Prairie</h3>
          <p>
            When Fishers was initially settled in 1802, the founder, William
            Conner, built a log cabin and trading post alongside the White
            River. Today, this intiial location and cabin is now surrounded by
            Conner Prairie, a living historical museum established in 1934. The
            museum is famous for it's historical accuracy with character actors
            re-enacting what life was like for settlers in the early 18th
            century alongside the White River. It also hosts many summer
            programs and camps, as well as outdoor music venues with the
            Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra.
